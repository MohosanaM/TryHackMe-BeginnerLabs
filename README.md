# TryHackMe Lab: Offensive Security Intro

Completed the "Offensive Security Intro" room on TryHackMe.  
This lab introduced me to ethical hacking by simulating a legal and safe environment to hack a website.  
I learned fundamental concepts of offensive security and how ethical hackers approach website vulnerabilities.  

Skills practiced: basic penetration testing, reconnaissance, and vulnerability assessment.  

Looking forward to tackling more advanced labs to deepen my cybersecurity expertise.
